Prompt:
An interactive story/almost-game? It's a dating simulator where you make your own choices about which dreamboat
you wanna go out with and how you wanna win (or lose?) their heart. It's like real dating if real dating was fake! 
It will feature my own art probably, some music I hope, and I'll incorporate things we learned in the past few weeks as I go along.

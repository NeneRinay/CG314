For my midterm, I'd like to make a game where you move a hamburger bun from side to side and try to catch indredients as they fall down.
The goal is to survive long enough to catch the top bun. Once you miss a single ingredient, you lose a life.

And alternative to this (though it's basically the same game) is to play as a dog who has to catch random food as it falls down.
